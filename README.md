# 🚀 Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for text classification. The model is trained on [Dataset Name] to classify text into predefined categories. The implementation demonstrates:
- Tokenization using **Hugging Face Transformers**.
- Fine-tuning **BERT-base** on a classification task.
- Model performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 🔍 Research Motivation
Fine-tuning pre-trained transformers like **BERT** has revolutionized NLP tasks. This project investigates:
- How **pre-trained knowledge** transfers to downstream tasks.
- The impact of **learning rate tuning** on model performance.
- Performance comparison between **fine-tuned BERT vs. traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM)**.
